# Explores allow you to join together different views (database tables) based on the
# relationships between fields. By joining a view into an Explore, you make those
# fields available to users for data analysis.
# Explores should be purpose-built for specific use cases.

# To see the Explore youâ€™re building, navigate to the Explore menu and select an Explore under "Main"
